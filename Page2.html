    <pl>This is Posiden, in the greek mythology he is know as the god of the sea <br>
    this means water aswell. He is also the god of earthquakes and horses.<br>

    <br>
    <img src="dog/horseposiden.jpg" alt="image of posidon with horses" width="40%"><br>
    <p2>
    in Greek Mythology Posiden created horses and there are two stories behind why he <br>
    did so in the first story he wanted to impress the goddess demeter as he has fallen <br>
    in love with her. After some time Posiden had created the horse, However after taking <br>
    so much time creating the horse Posiden had fallen out of love with the Goddess.<br>
    The other story shows the rivalry between him and the Goddess Athena both of which <br>
    wanted to be the patron god/dess of athens.To win over the leader of athens they both <br>
    presented gifts to the leader. Athena Had created the olive tree which gave wood, olive oil <br>
    and olives. In this version of the story Posiden creaes the horse to help out the city-state <br>
    of athens as then help in work,battles and transprtation.In another story he creates a well of <br>
    sea water instead of the horse.In both stories Athena wins the contest since this contest <br>
    Athena and Posiden have been rivals.
